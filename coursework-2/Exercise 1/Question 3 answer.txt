For question 2a the result of the gcd was 1 so they where coprime, 
however the result of gcd for 2b was 2.

The result of the isNPrime method for 2a: N is Prime
N is prime with certainity 1 is true
N is prime with certainity 2 is true
N is prime with certainity -1 is true

The result of the isNPrime method for 2b: N is Not Prime
N is prime with certainity 1 is false
N is prime with certainity 2 is false
N is prime with certainity -1 is true
